# Run
1. The detialed codes written in Matlab R2015b version in paper "RNR: A Generic Bayesian-based Framework for Enhancing Top-N Recommender Systems", submitted to WWW 2020 poster. 
2. Run main.m to show one of the experimental results. 
3. The code written in python 3.5 version is coming soon, please wait, thanks!
